# VieVS-VLBI_OPT

VLBI_OPT contains OPT-files for VLBI 24-h and partly Intensive sessions.

The OPT-files have been and are regularly created by present and former members of the Vienna Center for VLBI (Cooperation between TU Wien and the Austrian Federal Office of Metrology and Surveying - BEV, https://www.vlbi.at/).

As VieVS-VLBI, VieVS-VLBI_OPT is distributed under the GNU General Public License v3.0. You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this repository. If not, see http://www.gnu.org/licenses/.

## Usage
The OPT-files are provided in two different directories: VIENNA_NGS and VIENNA_VGOSDB. The splitting is due to the historical evolution of the data format, but the format of the OPT-files is the same. VIENNA_NGS covers mainly, but not exclusively the first part of the observation history 1979-2000 and VIENNA_VGOSDB covers mainly, but not exclusively the later part from 2001-present.
If you think you discovered an error in an OPT-file, please inform Sigrid Böhm.

## Branches
This is the master branch of the VLBI_OPT repository. It is regularly updated with new OPT-files and also subject to changes. The branch VIE2022b is a part of the master branch, with the contained files frozen at the status of the analysis done for the reference publication Krásná et al. (2023).
